# Text Classification API with FastAPI, Docker, and Hugging Face Transformers

## This repository provides a robust and scalable API for text classification tasks. It leverages FastAPI for building a user-friendly RESTful API, Docker for containerization, and Hugging Face Transformers for pre-trained NLP models.

### Key Features:

**Real-time Text Classification:** Analyze sentiment, emotions, or other categories from text data.
**Pre-trained Model:** Utilizes a fine-tuned Hugging Face Transformer model for efficient classification.
**RESTful API:** Easy integration with other applications through well-defined endpoints.
**Dockerized:** Ensures consistent and portable deployment across environments.
**Swagger UI:** Interactive documentation for API exploration and testing.
Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
Python 3.6+
Docker
**Installation:**
Bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Run the API:
Bash
docker build -t text-classification-api .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 text-classification-api:latest
Use code with caution.
The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI).
API Endpoints

GET /: Redirects to the Swagger UI for API documentation.
POST /analyze/: Accepts JSON data with a "text" field and returns the classification results.
Code Structure

main.py: Core application logic, defines endpoints, models, and integrates the pre-trained model.
test.py: Unit tests for the API endpoints.
Dockerfile: Defines the Docker image build process.
requirements.txt: Lists all project dependencies.
Technical Details

**FastAPI:** Web framework for building high-performance APIs.
**Hugging Face Transformers:** Provides access to pre-trained NLP models.
**Docker:** Enables containerization for easy deployment.
**Pydantic:** Data validation and modeling for API requests and responses.
**NLTK:** Library for text processing tasks (optional).
Customization

This project provides a starting point for building your text classification solution. You can customize it by:

Using a different pre-trained model from Hugging Face.
Expanding the API to support additional text classification tasks.
Integrating the API with your existing application or workflow.
